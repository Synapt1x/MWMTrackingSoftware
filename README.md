---

A software framework that uses a particle filter to track the location of a mouse during Morris Water Maze (MWM)
experiments. The intent is to build this framework as a very simple object-tracking software system for use in 
analyzing MWM experiments, but with the possibility of expanding this system to also incorporate tracking for
other systems.

The default system implements Kernelized Correlation Filtering (KCF) to track the mouse. The intent is to expand
and improve upon tracking for this particular application by also testing other filter trackers (Kalman and 
Particle) and CNN implementations such as YOLOv3.
