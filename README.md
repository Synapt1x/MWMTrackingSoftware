---

A software framework that uses a particle filter to track the location of a mouse during Morris Water Maze (MWM)
experiments. The intent is to build this framework as a very simple object-tracking software system for use in 
analyzing MWM experiments, but with the possibility of expanding this system to also incorporate tracking for
other systems.
